&lt;p&gt;My main goal is to create my presentations in Markdown and generate output in a form, which is the most suitable: it might be html or pdf.
With this approach, I can focus on the content, without thinking about how exactly it will be presented on a page. This is also a way to overcome a desire to squash too much on a single slide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Content is created in single Markdown document and output is generated with &lt;a href="https://pandoc.org/"&gt;Pandoc&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case of more interactive presentations, I use great HTML/JS framework: &lt;a href="https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/"&gt;reveal.js&lt;/a&gt;. In my setup Pandoc uses markdown document as an input and generates complete website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, you can take a look at presentation given at &lt;a href="https://www.meetup.com/pl-PL/LodzCEHUG/"&gt;CEHUG&lt;/a&gt; last year: &lt;a href="https://github.com/marek-gaw/presentations/tree/master/12_ROS_CEHUG"&gt;ROS: o robotach słów kilka&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="General"></category><category term="markdown"></category><category term="revealjs"></category><category term="pandoc"></category></entry><entry><title>Recruitment with Codility</title><link href="https://marek-gaw.github.io/blog/2018/03/recruitment-with-codility-EN.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-03-18T17:10:00+01:00</published><updated>2018-03-18T17:10:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Marek Gawryszewski</name></author><id>tag:marek-gaw.github.io,2018-03-18:/blog/2018/03/recruitment-with-codility-EN.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have taken Codility test - here are my thoughts about it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Recently I decided to take part in recruitment process for one of big companies in my area. One of process stages is to take part in &lt;a href="https://app.codility.com/programmers/"&gt;Codility&lt;/a&gt; contest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I already made my assignment, I feel like I have an idea how to take part in such events&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Know your enemy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no worse mistake in case of Codility test, than to not get familiar with the type of tasks to solve. Moreover, there are &lt;a href="https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/1-iterations/"&gt;lessons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://app.codility.com/programmers/challenges/"&gt;challenges&lt;/a&gt; which will show you, how the process works and, which is the vital part, what kind of tasks are there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prepare IDE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://app.codility.com/candidate-faq/"&gt;Official FAQ&lt;/a&gt; states, that using of external IDE is allowed. From my point of view it is not even encouraged. It is obligatory. It is not only because of code completion, in my case, it was easier to debug my code with GDB than use std::cout (which is available at Codility).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get familiar with data structures and algorithms&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the main area of topics (at least ones I saw and I am aware of). During the test, there is no time to ask Google, how linked list works, this is what we should know already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get familiar with your language&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also seems obvious, but it is good to know gotchas, which our tools have: in case of C++, it is good to know and understand STL algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take demo test&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is almost the same situation as we will have during real test: the time is constrained and our solution is assessed in the same way against correctness and performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practice, practice, practice&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no better way to learn how to solve puzzles than solving puzzles. I encourage everyone to solve some of available challenges to get familiar with the process, and to have an idea of what actual, &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; test will look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t feel like I was assessed extensively with Codility, or solving one or two riddles will show my ability to create good software. Anyway, this is a little bit better version of fizz-buzz test, originally proposed by Joel Spolsky on his &lt;a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/why-cant-programmers-program/"&gt;blog note: Why can&amp;rsquo;t programmers program?&lt;/a&gt; (I recommend to read other articles too!). So, I feel &amp;ldquo;not-so-sure&amp;rdquo; about Codility, but this is better way than white board programming, and if used as one of many, rather than only, step in recruitment process, it is good enough. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="General"></category><category term="Codility"></category><category term="Recruitment"></category></entry><entry><title>Mobilization 2017 and TDD Workshop - summary</title><link href="https://marek-gaw.github.io/blog/2017/10/mobilization-2017-summary.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-10-29T11:14:00+01:00</published><updated>2017-10-29T11:14:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Marek Gawryszewski</name></author><id>tag:marek-gaw.github.io,2017-10-29:/blog/2017/10/mobilization-2017-summary.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://2017.mobilization.pl/"&gt;Mobilization&lt;/a&gt; is probably the biggest IT conference which happens in Łódź, each year since 2011.

I attend this event each year since 2015 edition, so it was my third time, and I was pretty sure what I can expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presentations I attended:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to combine Swift/Kotlin with C/C++ by Michał Kowalczyk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one was interesting, because it involved C++. Michał showed, how to actually use C++ on mobile: his idea is to create reusable, platform-agnostic backend of application, and native frontend, for Android or iOS. This idea is worth considering, if your application has to be created and maintained for all (Android, iOS, Windows) platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Android Things 101 by Raul Portales&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using Android Things to detect &amp;amp; exterminate Reptilians by Gautier Mechling&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of those two presentations were more or less about the same: introduction to Android Things. Those presentation were not too deep in details, but gave me pretty good insight in Android Things, enough to draw my attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, before the main event, I attended workshop, made by guys from &lt;a href="https://www.elpassion.com/"&gt;EL Passion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From my point of view, this workshop was mainly about TDD in practice. Eventually, it was far more demanding: the main programming language was &lt;a href="https://kotlinlang.org/"&gt;Kotlin&lt;/a&gt;, and we were using extensively &lt;a href="https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava"&gt;RxJava&lt;/a&gt;. Obviously, those are not my main technologies, as Android is not, but I was going there to familiarize myself with Test Driven Development. Also, this was an opportunity to get to know Kotlin, which looks like very interesting replacement for Java. I think I need to go deeper in this topic, as it seems, that for Android, this will be main and leading technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those, who would like to know the agenda:&lt;a href="https://crossweb.pl/wydarzenia/kotlin-android-workshops-with-el-passion-listopad-2017/"&gt;Workshop  announcement&lt;/a&gt;.
For those, who would like to attend this workshop, you can do this for free &lt;a href="https://www.elpassion.com/workshops/android/"&gt;Workshop&lt;/a&gt; - I strongly recommend it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To sum up: the conference gave me an opportunity to learn something new, despite of the fact, that mobile is not my main topic of interest. Also, workshops, which were organized for the first time, is a great idea. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="General"></category><category term="Mobilization"></category><category term="TDD"></category><category term="Android Things"></category></entry><entry><title>High Impact Presentation by Dale Carnegie - my experience</title><link href="https://marek-gaw.github.io/blog/2017/10/high-impact-presentation-by-dale-carnegie---my-experience.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-10-05T14:09:00+02:00</published><updated>2017-10-06T14:09:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Marek Gawryszewski</name></author><id>tag:marek-gaw.github.io,2017-10-05:/blog/2017/10/high-impact-presentation-by-dale-carnegie---my-experience.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;My impressions and thoughts after attending High Impact Presentations by Dale Carnegie&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;September is a month of trainings for me - on first weekend I was attending &amp;ldquo;Akademia Trenera&amp;rdquo; ogranized by &lt;a href="www.sages.com.pl"&gt;Sages&lt;/a&gt; in cooperation with &lt;a href="www.metrosoft.com"&gt;Metrosoft&lt;/a&gt;, and later this month I went to Warsaw for &amp;ldquo;High Impact Presentations&amp;rdquo; by &lt;a href="http://www.dalecarnegie.com.pl/"&gt;Dale Carnegie Traing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whole training took 2 days: 8 hours each day, plus homework, and it was really busy days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From my point of view, the goal of whole training was to made as much presentations as possible. Indeed, during those two days, each of 12 participants had to stand before audience 7 times. Each presentation was recorded, and we were asked to point out our strengths and things which may be improved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make this training as productive as possible, two of  our presentations were slightly different: first was reading a speech - this was interesting because we were encouraged by trainers to play with our voice and body language. Second, was especailly interesting for me: Q&amp;amp;A session with though questions (we were asked to prepare some of them&amp;hellip;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite of the fact, that content of our presentations was not important at all (actually, we could say anything) but the form was still mastered: we had to stick some provided templates, which were prepared for specific task. For example: if presentation was given to present some complicated idea, presentation had to include some general analogy which allows audience to find something known in this new idea. Actually, each of our presentations had this strict structure, which was very useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genreal impression? I would recommend this training to anyone, who already made some presentations. This is important, because this training is about to move forward not to make baby steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I was impressed, how much I have changed since my first presentation there - I was convinced that my presentations are good already, but now I see that it was not always true, but hopefully - I found some tips to improve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year I was there with my presentation about connecting ROS and LabVIEW. I shown my results of small project which was created just because we need to connect sbRIO board to ROS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was supprising for me, how many networking opportunities I had during this conference. I met Anna Kuzminski, who is responsible for introducing Linux to NI&amp;rsquo;s embedded systems. As she told me, the feture is bright, as NI have chosen Linux as their main system for embedded controllers (maybe also PXI?). This is especially interesting for me, as I like to use myRIO with C or C++.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presentation is available on github: &lt;a href="http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/marek-gaw/meetup-python/blob/master/document/out/document.html#/"&gt;presentation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have shown 3 demos, below you can find source code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="demo-1"&gt;Demo 1&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#demo-1" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This demo shows how to send and receive data via topics in ROS. Nodes were created in Python, with rospy library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Files:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those files were taken from &lt;a href="http://wiki.ros.org/rospy_tutorials/Tutorials/WritingPublisherSubscriber"&gt;ROS Tutorial&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/marek-gaw/meetup-python/blob/master/demo/1.%20rospy%20nodes/talker.py"&gt;talker_rospy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/marek-gaw/meetup-python/blob/master/demo/1.%20rospy%20nodes/listener.py"&gt;listener_rospy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="demo-2"&gt;Demo 2&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#demo-2" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second demo was a little bit more complicated. I wanted to show how ROS may &amp;ldquo;talk&amp;rdquo; with non-ROS applications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ROS provides at least two solutions: [ros_serial] and [rosbridge].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First is dedicated to communication with devices like Arduino, over UART port, second is better for applications, which are able to communicate over WebSockets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shown how to receive data from ROS topic with Python client (using websocket-client package) and with webpage with JS library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Files:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those files were taken from &lt;a href="http://wiki.ros.org/roslibjs/Tutorials/BasicRosFunctionality"&gt;rosbridge tutorial&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29145442/threaded-non-blocking-websocket-client-in-python"&gt;this thread&lt;/a&gt; at Stack Overflow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last demo was quite straightforward: I wanted to show how to use OpenCV in Python. Goal of this app was to detect green object and draw circle around it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;File:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;File was taken from &lt;a href="http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/09/14/ball-tracking-with-opencv/"&gt;PyImageSearch blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If rqt is aware of installed plugins …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I just tried to use rqt in ROS Kinetic and I found, that only one plugin is installed by default: Container.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went trough some pages, and found some helpful info.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, install additional packges with plugins:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo apt install ros-kinetic-rqt*
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If rqt is aware of installed plugins, you will see them on the list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;rqt --list-plugins
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If this list is empty, or there is only few of plugins, force rqt to discover:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;rqt --force-discover
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This will also run rqt, and all installed plugins should be available.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="General"></category><category term="ROS"></category><category term="rqt"></category></entry><entry><title>Python Meetup: Python in Robotics</title><link href="https://marek-gaw.github.io/blog/2016/08/python-meetup-python-in-robotics.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-08-13T18:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2016-08-11T18:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Marek Gawryszewski</name></author><id>tag:marek-gaw.github.io,2016-08-13:/blog/2016/08/python-meetup-python-in-robotics.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was invited to show presentation about Python and robotics.
