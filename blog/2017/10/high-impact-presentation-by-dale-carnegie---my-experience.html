    <p>September is a month of trainings for me - on first weekend I was attending &ldquo;Akademia Trenera&rdquo; ogranized by <a href="www.sages.com.pl">Sages</a> in cooperation with <a href="www.metrosoft.com">Metrosoft</a>, and later this month I went to Warsaw for &ldquo;High Impact Presentations&rdquo; by <a href="http://www.dalecarnegie.com.pl/">Dale Carnegie Traing</a>.</p>
<p>Whole training took 2 days: 8 hours each day, plus homework, and it was really busy days. </p>
<p>From my point of view, the goal of whole training was to made as much presentations as possible. Indeed, during those two days, each of 12 participants had to stand before audience 7 times. Each presentation was recorded, and we were asked to point out our strengths and things which may be improved.</p>
<p>To make this training as productive as possible, two of  our presentations were slightly different: first was reading a speech - this was interesting because we were encouraged by trainers to play with our voice and body language. Second, was especailly interesting for me: Q&amp;A session with though questions (we were asked to prepare some of them&hellip;).</p>
<p>Despite of the fact, that content of our presentations was not important at all (actually, we could say anything) but the form was still mastered: we had to stick some provided templates, which were prepared for specific task. For example: if presentation was given to present some complicated idea, presentation had to include some general analogy which allows audience to find something known in this new idea. Actually, each of our presentations had this strict structure, which was very useful.</p>
<p>Genreal impression? I would recommend this training to anyone, who already made some presentations. This is important, because this training is about to move forward not to make baby steps.</p>
<p>Personally, I was impressed, how much I have changed since my first presentation there - I was convinced that my presentations are good already, but now I see that it was not always true, but hopefully - I found some tips to improve.</p>
