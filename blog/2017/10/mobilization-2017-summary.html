    <p><a href="http://2017.mobilization.pl/">Mobilization</a> is probably the biggest IT conference which happens in Łódź, each year since 2011. I attend this event each year since 2015 edition, so it was my third time, and I was pretty sure what I can expect.</p>
<p>Presentations I attended:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>How to combine Swift/Kotlin with C/C++ by Michał Kowalczyk</p>
<p>This one was interesting, because it involved C++. Michał showed, how to actually use C++ on mobile: his idea is to create reusable, platform-agnostic backend of application, and native frontend, for Android or iOS. This idea is worth considering, if your application has to be created and maintained for all (Android, iOS, Windows) platforms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Android Things 101 by Raul Portales</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using Android Things to detect &amp; exterminate Reptilians by Gautier Mechling</p>
<p>Both of those two presentations were more or less about the same: introduction to Android Things. Those presentation were not too deep in details, but gave me pretty good insight in Android Things, enough to draw my attention.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This time, before the main event, I attended workshop, made by guys from <a href="https://www.elpassion.com/">EL Passion</a>.</p>
<p>From my point of view, this workshop was mainly about TDD in practice. Eventually, it was far more demanding: the main programming language was <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/">Kotlin</a>, and we were using extensively <a href="https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava">RxJava</a>. Obviously, those are not my main technologies, as Android is not, but I was going there to familiarize myself with Test Driven Development. Also, this was an opportunity to get to know Kotlin, which looks like very interesting replacement for Java. I think I need to go deeper in this topic, as it seems, that for Android, this will be main and leading technology.</p>
<p>For those, who would like to know the agenda:<a href="https://crossweb.pl/wydarzenia/kotlin-android-workshops-with-el-passion-listopad-2017/">Workshop  announcement</a>.
For those, who would like to attend this workshop, you can do this for free <a href="https://www.elpassion.com/workshops/android/">Workshop</a> - I strongly recommend it!</p>
<p>To sum up: the conference gave me an opportunity to learn something new, despite of the fact, that mobile is not my main topic of interest. Also, workshops, which were organized for the first time, is a great idea. </p>
